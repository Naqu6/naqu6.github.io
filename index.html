				About Us
			</div>

			<div class="pane-body">
				B & S Delivery Ltd. has been providing same day courier services to businesses in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) since 1989.

				Whether you are sending an envelope or a van load - across town or across the street - you won't get better service anywhere.

				And that's guaranteed. Our first rate drivers, dispatch and ordering system make sure of it.

				<br>
				<br>

				Our dispatch system has been perfected to ensure that the right driver in the right vehicle arrives at the right place at the right time.

				Our drivers have been personally selected for their driving abilities and their commitment to service - making sure your package gets to where it needs to be - when it needs to be there.

				Our ordering and billing system makes sure you always know what went where, when and for how much.

				<br>
				<br>

				We offer a range of 5 service levels - early bird, 5 hour, rush, direct, door to door - at prices that are highly competitive.

				Of course, we are constantly looking at ways to improve.

				Case in point - in response to the needs of our customers we have introduced an online ordering system.

				Another case in point - it is now possible to charge our service to your VISA, MasterCard or American Express credit card (a good way to earn some extra travel points).

				<br>
				<br>


				If you are looking for a better way to get your parcels and packages around the GTA, be sure to give us a call. We can discuss what is most important to you and ensure your needs are met.

				That's Better Service, Guaranteed.
